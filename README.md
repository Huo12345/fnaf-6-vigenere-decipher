# Game Theory brute force vigenere decipher

## Background
This Project was created to help the community of the YouTube channel 
[The Game Theorists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo_IB5145EVNcf8hw1Kku7w)
solving the riddles placed in the game FNAF 6 Ultimate Custom Night as presented in 
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_0WNLAmSaE).

## How it works
This Java project is a brute force vigenere decipher running through every possible key containing up to five letters 
and checking against a DB of common names for a match. If found the result is printed in the following way:

MATCH   Key: "key here", Value:"name here", Gender: gender (f/m) here

## For the Theorists
If you are a fellow theorist and want to help with the search of the needle in the hey stack, we need to find a key 
which is in any way FNAF related. With this it should be possible to crack this riddle. The matches are in the file 
resources/matches.txt. In theory the key could be longer than the given 5 characters, but then the decipher would match 
any possible combinations of letters after the match 

If you are a coder and want to help, there are different implementations of the vigenere cipher, so feel free to fork 
and add missing implementations.
